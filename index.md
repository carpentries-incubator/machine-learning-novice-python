This lesson was designed for researchers interested in applying machine learning approaches for prediction and classification. Following health narratives using anonymised, real-world patient data, we cover common terminology around data preparation and resampling, model building, and evaluation. The lesson is a prerequisite for the other lessons in the machine learning curriculum.
