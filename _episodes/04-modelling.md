## Regression vs classification

In our previous example, we predicted blood length of hospital stay from a severity of illness score using linear regression. The task of predicting a continuous variable is typically referred to as a *regression*. 

Our new goal is to predict the outcome (in-hospital mortality) of hospital patients. Predicting one or more classes is typically referred to as *classification*.  Slightly confusingly regression models can be used for both regression tasks and classification tasks. Don't let this throw you off!

Recall that our function for a linear regression is:

$$
\hat{y} = wX + b
$$

Our prediction target (in-hospital mortality) is denoted by $\hat{y}$ and our explanatory variables or "features" are denoted by $X$. In our case, we will use a single feature: the APACHE-IV score, another measure of severity of illness. $w$ is weight and $b$ is bias. Could we use a linear regression for our classification task? Let's try fitting a line to our outcome data.

```python
# import the regression model
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
reg = LinearRegression()

# use a single feature (apache score)
X = cohort.apachescore.values.reshape((len(cohort.apachescore.values), 1))
y = cohort.actualhospitalmortality_enc.values

# fit the model to our data
reg = reg.fit(X, y)

# get the y values
buffer = 0.2*max(X)
X_fit = np.linspace(min(X) - buffer, max(X) + buffer, num=50)
y_fit = reg.predict(X_fit)

# plot
plt.scatter(X, y,  color='black', marker = 'x')
plt.plot(X_fit, y_fit, color='red', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

Linear regression is used to place a line through a set of data points that minimizes error between the line and the points. It is difficult to see how a meaningful threshold could be set to predict the binary outcome in our task. The predicted values can exceed our range of outcomes.

## Sigmoid function

The sigmoid function (also known as a logistic function) comes to our rescue. This function gives an "s" shaped curve that can take a number and map it into a value between 0 and 1: 

$$f : \mathbb{R} \mapsto (0,1) $$ 

The sigmoid function can be written as:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

Let's take a look at a curve generated by this function:

```python
def sigmoid(x, k=0.1):
    """
    Sigmoid function. 
    Adjust k to set slope.
    """
    s = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x / k)) 
    return s

# set range of values for x
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 50)

plt.plot(x, sigmoid(x))
plt.show()
```

![Sigmoid function](../fig/section5-fig2.png){: width="600px"}

We can use this to map our linear regression to produce output values that fall between 0 and 1.

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-({wX + b})}}
$$

As an added benefit, we can interpret the output value as a probability. The probability relates to the positive class (the outcome with value "1"), which in our case is in-hospital mortality ("EXPIRED").

## Training (or fitting) the model

We need to find the parameters for the best-fitting logistic model given our data. As before, we do this with the help of a loss function that quantifies error. Our goal is to find the parameters of the model that minimise the error.

With this model, we no longer use least squares due to the model's non-linear properties. Instead we compute the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). As is typically the case when using machine learning packages, we don't need to code the loss function ourselves. The function is implemented as part of our machine learning package (in this case [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))

Let's try again, this time with Logistic Regression.

```python
# import the regression model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)

# use a single feature (apache score)
X = cohort.apachescore.values.reshape((len(cohort.apachescore.values), 1))
y = cohort.actualhospitalmortality_enc.values

# fit the model to our data
reg = reg.fit(X, y)

# get the y values
buffer = 0.2*max(X)
X_fit = np.linspace(min(X) - buffer, max(X) + buffer, num=50)
y_fit = reg.predict(X_fit)

# plot
plt.scatter(X, y,  color='black', marker = 'x')
plt.plot(X_fit, y_fit, color='red', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

## Decision boundary

Now that our model is able to output the probability of our outcome, we can set a decision boundary for the classification task. For example, we could classify probabilities of < 0.5 as "ALIVE" and >= 0.5 as "EXPIRED". Using this approach, we can predict outcomes for a given input.

```python
x = [[90]]
outcome = reg.predict(x)
probs = reg.predict_proba(x)[0]
print(f'For x={x[0][0]}, we predict an outcome of "{outcome[0]}".\n'
      f'Class probabilities (0, 1): {round(probs[0],2), round(probs[1],2)}.')
```

```
For x=90, we predict an outcome of "0".
Class probabilities (0, 1): (0.77, 0.23).
```
